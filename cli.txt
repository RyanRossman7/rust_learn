A paracosm is a detailed imaginary world thought generally to originate in childhood.
        The creator of a paracosm has a complex and deeply felt relationship with this subjective universe, 
            which may incorporate real-world or imaginary characters and conventions. 
                Commonly having its own geography, history, and language, 
                    it is an experience that is often developed during childhood
                        and continues over a long period of time, 
                         months or even years,
                            as a sophisticated reality 
                                that can last into adulthood.
